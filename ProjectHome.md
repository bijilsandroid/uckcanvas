I've created a whiteboard prototype using flex 3.0.
It has very few simple features and it's at early development stage.
I just wanted to show you my work and if you're interested in , just try.
Actually i'm new to Flex and Actionscript, so there might be many bugs.
If you have, I'm glad to work with you to make it better library.

Features:
> - Text box tool
> - Pen sketch tool
> - Rectangle box tool
> - Image tool
> - Selectioin tool
> > - move, resize, rotation and multiple selection

> - Style property for text box, pen, rectangle
> > - font family
> > - font size
> > - font color
> > - font style
> > - fill (background)
> > - stroke (border)

To use image tool you need server side script. I'wll put the script and simple document
about the library soon.

Download:
Just download the project zip file from download page.
The file is a Flex 3 project, so you can just import.

Any comments are appreciated.
